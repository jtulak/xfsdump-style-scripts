# regex explanation:
# We are avoiding strings - replacing only those spaces that are not surrounded
# by ". At the same time, we want to ignore also those cases, where
# there are only whitespace in front of the commas/semicolons, as those are
#Â likely aligned. At the end, return a space between two semicolons in cases
# like for (foo ; ; bar), where the spaces are important for readability.
